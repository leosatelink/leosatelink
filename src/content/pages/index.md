## What is Schema-Driven Development?

Schema-driven development is a modern approach to web development that uses structured schemas to define your content and components. This approach offers several key benefits:

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at build time rather than runtime
- **Consistency**: Ensure your content follows predefined structures
- **Developer Experience**: Get autocomplete and validation in your IDE
- **Maintainability**: Make changes with confidence knowing your schema will catch issues

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Node.js 18+ installed
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript and Markdown

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/greynewell/schema-driven-astro-starter.git
cd schema-driven-astro-starter
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Understanding the Project Structure

The project follows a schema-driven architecture:

```
src/
├── content/          # Your markdown content
├── components/       # Reusable UI components
├── schemas/         # Content schemas
└── layouts/         # Page layouts
```

## Git-Based CMS: Content Management Made Developer-Friendly

One of the standout features of this starter is its git-based CMS approach. This means your content is managed through Git, making it perfect for developer teams and technical content creators.

### Accessing the Admin Interface

1. Navigate to `/admin` in your browser when running the development server
2. You'll see a clean, user-friendly interface for managing your content
3. The admin interface is automatically generated based on your schemas

### Benefits of Git-Based CMS

- **Version Control**: Track all content changes in Git
- **Collaboration**: Multiple team members can work on content simultaneously
- **Review Process**: Use pull requests for content review
- **Rollback Capability**: Easily revert content changes
- **Developer Workflow**: Content management fits naturally into the development process

### Using the Admin Interface

The admin interface provides several powerful features:

1. **Content Creation**
   - Create new pages and posts with a visual editor

   ```bash
   # Start the development server with admin interface
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Content Creation**
   - Use the admin interface at `/admin`
   - Create and edit content
   - Changes are saved as markdown files in your `content` directory

   git status
   
   # Commit your content changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update content: [description]"
   ```

```

2. The page will automatically be available at `/my-new-page`

  content: string;
}
```

## Structured Data and SEO Optimization

The Schema-Driven Astro Starter takes SEO to the next level with built-in support for structured data using JSON-LD and schema.org standards.

### JSON-LD Implementation

JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) is implemented throughout the site to provide search engines with rich, structured information about your content:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebSite",
  "name": "Your Website Name",
  "url": "https://yourwebsite.com",
  "description": "Your website description"
}
```

### Benefits of Structured Data

1. **Enhanced Search Results**
   - Rich snippets in search results
   - Knowledge graph integration
   - Improved click-through rates

2. **Better Content Understanding**
   - Search engines better understand your content
   - More accurate indexing
   - Improved relevance in search results

3. **Automated Schema Generation**
   - Schemas automatically generate appropriate JSON-LD
   - Type-safe structured data
   - Consistent implementation across the site

### Schema.org Integration

The starter is built around the [WebSite](https://schema.org/WebSite) schema as its foundation, providing a robust structure for your site's content and metadata. This core implementation ensures that search engines understand your website's basic structure and purpose.

#### Core Implementation

The WebSite schema is automatically generated for your site, including:
- Site name and description
- URL structure
- Search functionality
- Social media profiles
- Copyright information

This foundation makes it easy to extend your site with additional schema.org types as needed.

#### Extending with Additional Schemas

While the starter provides the WebSite schema implementation out of the box, you can easily extend your content with other schema.org types. Here are some popular additions you might consider:

1. **Content Types**
   - [Article](https://schema.org/Article): For blog posts and news articles
   - [WebPage](https://schema.org/WebPage): For standard pages
   - [BreadcrumbList](https://schema.org/BreadcrumbList): For navigation structure

2. **Organization Types**
   - [Organization](https://schema.org/Organization): For company information
   - [Person](https://schema.org/Person): For team members and authors

3. **E-commerce Types** (if needed)
   - [Product](https://schema.org/Product): For product listings
   - [Offer](https://schema.org/Offer): For pricing information
   - [Review](https://schema.org/Review): For customer feedback

The schema-driven architecture makes it simple to add these additional types by extending your content schemas. Each new schema type you add will automatically generate the appropriate JSON-LD markup.

### Testing Structured Data

The starter includes tools to validate your structured data:

1. **Google Rich Results Test**
   - Validate your JSON-LD implementation
   - Preview how your content appears in search results
   - Identify and fix structured data issues

2. **Schema.org Validator**
   - Ensure compliance with schema.org standards
   - Verify property usage
   - Check for missing required fields

### Best Practices

1. **Schema Selection**
   - Choose the most specific schema type for your content
   - Use nested schemas when appropriate
   - Follow schema.org guidelines

2. **Implementation**
   - Keep structured data up to date
   - Validate changes before deployment
   - Monitor search console for issues

3. **Maintenance**
   - Regular validation of structured data
   - Update schemas as content changes
   - Monitor search performance
